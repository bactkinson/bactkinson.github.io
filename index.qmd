Hey, my name is Blake. Welcome to my personal site. I'm interested in the intersection between statistics and environmental science. Feel free to click around and explore.

In graduate school, I worked on developing statistical methods for analyzing air pollution measurements taken from instruments on things that were moving, 
such as cars. While it may not seem obvious, analyzing these measurements gets pretty complicated since they vary in both time and space. One thing in particular that 
gets a little complicated is determining background, or what the concentrations of air pollutants would be in a "clean" environment free from any nearby
sources. Determining background is important because it enables you to subsequently determine how much a nearby source is contributing to observed air pollution.

I had a lot of fun writing an algorithm that could tackle background calculation and called it State-Informed Background Removal, or SIBaR for short. From a 
high-level, SIBaR works by determining periods of time in which a moving air monitor is in a "clean" area and when it's in a "dirty" area, and then uses the 
measurements in the clean area to estimate background in the dirtier areas. It uses a class of statistical models called Hidden Markov Models, or HMMs, to do so.
A good source for learning about HMMs is a tutorial written by Lawrence Rabiner in IEEE, found [here.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.1991.10484833)
